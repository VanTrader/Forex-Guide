## What Is a Forex Spread?

A Forex spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices quoted by your broker. It‚Äôs measured in pips and represents the cost you pay per trade.

---

## Why Spreads Matter

- ‚úÖ **Cost Efficiency**: Tighter spreads lower your transaction costs and boost profitability.  
- ‚úÖ **Scalping Viability**: Scalpers need spreads below 1 pip to benefit from small market moves.  
- ‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Tight spreads help manage entry/exit points more precisely.

---

## What Is a Good Spread?

- **Major Pairs** (EUR/USD, USD/JPY):  
  - ECN accounts: 0.0‚Äì0.5 pips  
  - Standard accounts: 1‚Äì2 pips  

- **Minor Pairs**:  
  - Typically 2‚Äì4 pips  

- **Exotic Pairs**:  
  - Often over 5 pips  

A "good" spread is always relative to your strategy and the market conditions.

---

## Factors Influencing Spreads

### 4.1 Market Liquidity  
More liquid markets like EUR/USD offer tighter spreads due to higher volume.

### 4.2 Trading Session  
Spreads are lowest during high-volume sessions like the London‚ÄìNew York overlap.

### 4.3 Currency Pair & Volatility  
Volatile pairs like GBP/JPY may have higher spreads, especially during news events.

### 4.4 Broker Model  
- **ECN/STP brokers**: Raw spreads with commission.  
- **Market Makers**: Wider spreads with no commissions.
