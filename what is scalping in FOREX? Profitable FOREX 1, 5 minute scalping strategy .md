## Understanding Scalping in Forex  
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Scalping is all about speed and precision. Traders look to exploit micro-movements in currency pairs, often targeting **3‚Äì10 pips** per trade. Unlike swing trading that holds positions for hours or days, scalpers rely on technical setups on **1-minute (M1)** and **5-minute (M5)** charts, combined with low-latency execution.

- **Entry & Exit**: Rapid order placement at key support/resistance or momentum bursts.  
- **Volume**: High trade frequency reduces dependence on large moves.  
- **Tools**: Simple indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) and price action are preferred over complex systems.

## Why Scalping Appeals to Traders  
üí°  
1. **Quick Feedback Loop**: Immediate results help refine strategies faster.  
2. **Reduced Overnight Risk**: No positions held during news gaps.  
3. **Consistent Small Gains**: Accumulate many small wins for steady growth.  
4. **Leverage Efficiency**: Small stop-losses allow higher leverage with controlled risk.

Both **beginners** and **veteran** scalpers benefit‚Äînovices learn fast, while experts optimize edge.

## Key Components of a Successful Scalping Strategy  
### Market Conditions  
üåê Scalping performs best in **high-liquidity** and **low-volatility** environments, such as during the London‚ÄìNew York overlap. Avoid thin markets (Asian session exotics).

### Tight Spreads & Execution  
‚ö°Ô∏è Low spreads (‚â§1 pip on EUR/USD) and instant fills are essential. Even **0.1 pip** advantage per trade compounds significantly over hundreds of scalps.

### Risk Management  
üõë  
- **Risk per Trade**: Never exceed **0.5‚Äì1%** of account balance.  
- **Stop-Loss**: Set just beyond micro-support/resistance.  
- **Take-Profit**: Aim for **1:1** or **1:2** reward-to-risk ratios.
