## Understanding Fair Value Gap  
A **Fair Value Gap** is created when price moves sharply in one direction, leaving behind a disparity between buy and sell orders. On a candlestick chart, an FVG appears as a gap between the high of one candle and the low of the next (or vice versa) with little to no overlap in between. üîç  

- üìä **Institutional Footprint**: Major banks and hedge funds execute large orders, causing rapid price moves that bypass certain price levels.  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Price Inefficiency**: The untraded price area represents a zone where liquidity awaits‚Äîprice often returns to ‚Äúfill‚Äù this gap before resuming its trend.  

## Why Fair Value Gaps Matter  
1. **High-Probability Entries**: FVG zones act as magnets. Traders using FVGs often find precise entries with tight stops.  
2. **Clear Risk-Reward**: Entry at the gap edge, stop beyond the gap, target at recent structure points.  
3. **Confluence with Other Tools**: When FVGs align with order blocks, liquidity pools, or Fibonacci levels, signals strengthen.  
4. **Market Psychology Insight**: FVGs reveal where institutional players swept retail stops‚Äîunderstanding this dynamic helps avoid common pitfalls.  

## Types of Fair Value Gaps  
| Gap Type               | Description                                                                                   | Chart Example                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Bullish FVG** üü¢     | Gap created during a strong up move‚Äîlow of 2nd candle above high of 1st candle.               | Price jumps from 1.1000 ‚Üí 1.1050   |
| **Bearish FVG** üî¥      | Gap formed in a sharp downtrend‚Äîhigh of 2nd candle below low of 1st candle.                  | Price plunges from 1.1100 ‚Üí 1.1050 |
| **Micro FVG** üêú       | Small gaps on lower timeframes (M5‚ÄìM15) often used by scalpers for quick entries.             | 5-pip gap on 5-min chart           |
| **Macro FVG** ü¶ç       | Larger gaps on higher timeframes (H1‚ÄìD1) indicating institutional interest zones.             | 50-pip gap on H4 chart             |

## How to Identify Fair Value Gaps on Your Chart  
1. **Select Timeframe** ‚è∞  
   - **Higher TF (H1‚ÄìH4)** for swing trades‚Äîidentifies stronger FVGs.  
   - **Lower TF (M5‚ÄìM15)** for intraday scalping‚Äîmarks micro FVGs.  
2. **Spot Sharp Moves** üöÄ  
   - Find candles with little to no wick overlap.  
3. **Draw FVG Zone** üé®  
   - Mark from the close of the first candle to the open of the second (for bullish) or vice versa (for bearish).  
4. **Confirm with Volume** üìà  
   - Volume spikes during gap creation often validate institutional activity.  
5. **Look for Confluence** üîó  
   - Align FVG with prior order blocks, pivot levels, or trendlines for additional confidence.  

## Step-by-Step FVG Trading Strategy  
1. **Identify Trend Direction** üîÑ  
   - Use moving averages (50/200 EMA) or higher-TF swing structure.  
2. **Mark FVG Zone** üìã  
   - Highlight the gap zone on the chart.  
3. **Wait for Retracement** üîÑ  
   - Allow price to return into the gap‚Äîbe patient.  
4. **Check Confluence** ‚úÖ  
   - Ensure FVG overlaps with an order block or key S/R.  
5. **Enter Limit Order** üéØ  
   - Place buy at bottom of bullish FVG, sell at top of bearish FVG.  
6. **Set Stop-Loss** üõë  
   - Beyond gap edge or recent swing low/high.  
7. **Define Target** üéØ  
   - Recent structure high/low or measure-equal move (1:2 RR or better).  
8. **Manage Trade** üìù  
   - Move stop to break-even when price covers 50% of RR, trail stops for extended runs.  

## Tips for Beginners  
- üõë **Start on Demo**: Practice identifying and trading FVGs without risking capital.  
- üìà **Use Higher Timeframes**: H1‚ÄìH4 gaps are more reliable and easier to spot.  
- üìä **Limit to Major Pairs**: EUR/USD, GBP/USD have deeper liquidity, cleaner FVGs.  
- üìù **Keep a Journal**: Record each FVG trade‚Äîentry, stop, outcome, lessons learned.  
- üéØ **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 1‚Äì2% per trade; use clear stops.  

## Advanced Techniques for Experienced Traders  
- ü§ñ **Automate FVG Detection**: Use scripts or Expert Advisors to highlight gaps across multiple pairs/timeframes.  
- üß† **Order Flow Confirmation**: Combine FVGs with footprint or DOM data to see real-time liquidity.  
- üîÑ **Multi-Timeframe Confluence**: Align FVG on H4 with order block on D1 for institutional-grade signals.  
- üï∞Ô∏è **Session Bias**: Trade gaps formed during London/New York overlap for higher odds.  
- üìâ **Statistical Analysis**: Backtest FVG performance on historical data to refine entry buffers and RR targets.
