## What Is a Funded Forex Account?  
üí° A **funded forex account** is provided by proprietary trading firms (prop firms) or selected brokers, allowing traders to trade live capital after meeting certain criteria. Instead of risking your own funds, you pass an evaluation‚Äîdemonstrating risk management and profitability‚Äîand in return you gain access to a pool of capital. Profits are split, commonly 70/30 to 80/20 in favor of the trader.

Key features:  
- **Evaluation Stage**: Traders complete tasks (profit targets, max drawdown) on a demo.  
- **Live Funding**: Upon passing, you receive real capital to trade.  
- **Profit Split**: Shared profits, with no or minimal personal capital at risk.  

## Types of Funded Account Programs  
### Challenge/Evaluation Accounts  
üîç **Evaluation-based** programs require traders to reach profit targets and adhere to drawdown limits in a demo before funding. Common structure:  
- **Phase 1**: Profit target (e.g., +8%) in 30 days.  
- **Phase 2**: Smaller target (e.g., +5%) in fewer days.  
- **Live Account**: Approved balance (e.g., $25K) with real trades.

### Instant Funding Accounts  
‚ö° **Instant funding** skips lengthy challenges. Providers review your track record or subscription, then offer immediate capital‚Äîoften for a fee or revenue share.

### Hybrid Models  
üîÄ Combine evaluation and performance fees. Traders pay a modest fee for evaluation, pass a shorter challenge, then pay a small monthly subscription for ongoing access.
