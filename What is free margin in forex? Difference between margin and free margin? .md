## 11. FAQs  

1. **What happens if my free margin reaches zero?**  
If free margin hits zero, you cannot open new positions. Further losses reduce equity below used margin, triggering a margin call or automatic position liquidation.

2. **Can I increase my free margin without depositing more funds?**  
Yes. Closing losing positions or reducing lot sizes frees up used margin, thus increasing free margin.

3. **Is higher leverage always better for free margin?**  
No. While higher leverage lowers initial margin requirements, it amplifies risk, potentially depleting your free margin faster.

4. **How do swap and commissions affect free margin?**  
Overnight swaps and commission fees are deducted from your equity, which reduces both equity and free margin over time.

5. **Whatâ€™s the ideal free margin level to maintain?**  
Aim to keep free margin above 50% of your account balance as a conservative buffer, though your risk tolerance and strategy may vary.
