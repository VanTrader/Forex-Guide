## 1. Introduction  
In forex trading, **margin** and **free margin** are foundational concepts that dictate how much capital you need to open positions and how many new trades you can initiate. While margin ensures that your broker holds a security deposit against your open positions, free margin represents the untapped portion of your funds. Grasping these concepts helps you trade confidently, avoid liquidation, and scale your positions effectively.

## 2. Key Forex Terms  

### 2.1 What Is Margin?  
- **Margin** is the collateral required by your broker to maintain open positions.  
- It is a fraction of the full contract size, determined by your chosen leverage (e.g., 1% margin for 1:100 leverage).  
- Margin protects brokers from default risk if your position moves against you.

### 2.2 What Is Free Margin?  
- **Free Margin** = **Equity** âˆ’ **Used Margin**.  
- It represents the available funds for opening new trades or absorbing unrealized losses.  
- Maintaining positive free margin is essential to avoid margin calls and forced liquidation.

### 2.3 What Is Used Margin?  
- **Used Margin** is the sum of all margins currently allocated to your open positions.  
- As you open new trades, used margin increases, reducing your free margin.

### 2.4 Equity vs. Balance  
- **Balance**: Your account value excluding unrealized profits/losses.  
- **Equity** = **Balance** + **Floating P/L** (unrealized profits or losses).  
- Equity fluctuates in real-time with market movements; free margin depends on equity.

## 3. How to Calculate Free Margin  
1. **Determine Equity**:  
2. **Subtract Used Margin**:  

3. **Example**:  
- Balance: $10,000  
- Unrealized P/L: +$200  
- Used Margin: $1,000  
- Equity = $10,200 â†’ Free Margin = $10,200 âˆ’ $1,000 = $9,200

## 5. Practical Examples  

### 5.1 Example for Beginners

- **Used Margin:** $1,200

## 11. FAQs  

1. **What happens if my free margin reaches zero?**  
If free margin hits zero, you cannot open new positions. Further losses reduce equity below used margin, triggering a margin call or automatic position liquidation.

2. **Can I increase my free margin without depositing more funds?**  
Yes. Closing losing positions or reducing lot sizes frees up used margin, thus increasing free margin.

3. **Is higher leverage always better for free margin?**  
No. While higher leverage lowers initial margin requirements, it amplifies risk, potentially depleting your free margin faster.

4. **How do swap and commissions affect free margin?**  
Overnight swaps and commission fees are deducted from your equity, which reduces both equity and free margin over time.

5. **Whatâ€™s the ideal free margin level to maintain?**  
Aim to keep free margin above 50% of your account balance as a conservative buffer, though your risk tolerance and strategy may vary.
