## Tips & Best Practices for Break Even Management  
🛠️ **1. Wait for Confirmation**  
– Ensure price momentum is strong before moving your stop.  

🛠️ **2. Account for Spread**  
– Always add/subtract spread so break even truly covers costs.  

🛠️ **3. Use a Buffer**  
– Set SL a few points beyond entry to avoid random spikes.  

🛠️ **4. Combine with Trailing Stops**  
– After break even, trail at 1:1 or 1:2 risk-reward to lock more profits.  

🛠️ **5. Backtest Your Rules**  
– Test break even triggers and buffers on historical data.
