## Introduction to Deviation in FOREX üîç

Deviation in Forex refers to the maximum difference between the price you expect to pay (or receive) for a currency pair and the actual price at which your order is executed. This difference is commonly referred to as *slippage*.

In platforms like MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), traders can set a deviation level to control how much slippage they are willing to tolerate. This ensures more predictable trade outcomes during periods of high volatility.

## Why is Deviation Important in FOREX Trading? üí°

- üìâ **Volatility Protection**: During major news events or low liquidity times, prices can move rapidly. Setting a deviation limit protects your trades from entering at unintended price points.
- üïí **Faster Execution**: A small allowed deviation can help orders get filled faster, reducing delays and missed opportunities.
- üíµ **Controlled Risk**: Avoid significant losses due to unfavorable price shifts.

## How to Set Deviation in MT4 ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Open your MT4 platform.
2. Click on the "New Order" button.
3. In the order window, check the box labeled "Enable maximum deviation from quoted price."
4. Set the number of points you are willing to allow (e.g., 10 points = 1 pip).
5. Proceed with your trade.

üß† **Tip**: Test different deviation levels in a demo account to see what works best under various market conditions.

## How to Set Deviation in MT5 üõ†Ô∏è

1. Launch MT5 and log in to your account.
2. Open the order panel.
3. Click on "Advanced" or the gear icon to view additional options.
4. Set your preferred deviation (in points).
5. Place your order normally.

üìä MT5 also allows algorithmic trading and Expert Advisors (EAs) to define deviation programmatically.

## Tips for Managing Slippage Effectively ‚úÖ

- Use **limit orders** instead of market orders when precision is crucial.
- Trade during **high liquidity sessions** (e.g., London/New York overlap).
- Monitor **news events** and avoid placing trades during high-impact announcements if slippage is a concern.
- Choose brokers with **low latency** and **reliable execution** policies.

**Answer**: Yes, in both MT4 and MT5, EAs can define maximum deviation in their parameters.

### 4. Does higher deviation mean higher risk?

**Answer**: Not necessarily. It depends on market conditions. Higher deviation gives flexibility but can lead to worse pricing.
