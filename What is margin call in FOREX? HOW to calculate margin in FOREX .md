- **Trade Volume**: Number of lots × lot size (e.g., 1 lot = 100,000 units).  
- **Leverage**: e.g., 1:100.  
- **Contract Size**: Standard lot = 100,000.  
- **Current Price**: Exchange rate for the pair.

### Step-by-Step Calculation  
1. Choose pair: EUR/USD at price 1.1200  
2. Volume: 0.5 standard lots = 50,000 units  
3. Leverage: 1:100  
4. Required Margin = (50,000 / 100) × (1 / 1.1200) = $446.43

## How to Avoid a Margin Call  
🛡️  
1. **Use Appropriate Leverage** – Lower leverage reduces required margin.  
2. **Maintain Healthy Free Margin** – Never use 100% of your margin.  
3. **Set Realistic Position Sizes** – Risk only a small % per trade.  
4. **Use Stop-Loss Orders** – Cap your losses in advance.  
5. **Monitor Margin Level** – Keep an eye on your margin percentage.  
6. **Diversify Positions** – Avoid correlated trades that amplify drawdown.
