## Understanding Margin in Forex  
üí° **Margin** is the collateral you need to open and maintain a leveraged position. It is *not* a fee but a portion of your equity set aside by the broker.  
- **Required Margin**: The amount needed to open a position.  
- **Used Margin**: Total margin tied up in open trades.  
- **Free Margin**: Equity minus used margin‚Äîavailable for new trades and to absorb floating losses.  
- **Margin Level (%)**: (Equity / Used Margin) √ó 100  

### Example  
- Account Balance: $1,000  
- Leverage: 1:100  
- Opening 1 standard lot EUR/USD (100,000 units) requires margin:  
  100,000 / 100 = $1,000

## What Is a Margin Call?  
üö® A **margin call** occurs when your margin level falls below the broker‚Äôs threshold (commonly 100% or 50%). At this point:  
1. You receive an alert (email, pop-up).  
2. You must deposit more funds or close losing positions.  
3. If not addressed, the broker may close positions automatically at the **stop-out** level.

Margin calls protect traders from negative equity and brokers from unrecoverable losses.

## How to Calculate Margin  
üî¢ **Required Margin** formula:  

- **Trade Volume**: Number of lots √ó lot size (e.g., 1 lot = 100,000 units).  
- **Leverage**: e.g., 1:100.  
- **Contract Size**: Standard lot = 100,000.  
- **Current Price**: Exchange rate for the pair.

### Step-by-Step Calculation  
1. Choose pair: EUR/USD at price 1.1200  
2. Volume: 0.5 standard lots = 50,000 units  
3. Leverage: 1:100  
4. Required Margin = (50,000 / 100) √ó (1 / 1.1200) = $446.43
